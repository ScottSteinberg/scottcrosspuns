# ScottCrossPuns Crossword Puzzle Generating Algorithm
This summer, I've ventured into a new world by opening up an Etsy store to sell crossword puzzles. While generating my first few puzzles, I couldn't help but notice that my process of generating puzzles was inefficient, so I set out to create my own better solution. 

This algorithm takes two main inputs: a number n to generate an nxn crossword puzzle and a list of names or words that need to be imputted into the puzzle. Given these inputs, the algorithm looks for the best, most compact puzzles I can provide for my clients.

I'm still tinkering with ways I can make this puzzle generation more efficient, but I think my solution is the best publicly accessible crossword puzzle algorithm I've seen. If you find this algorithm interesting and also happen to enjoy puns, feel free to check out my Etsy shop below:
